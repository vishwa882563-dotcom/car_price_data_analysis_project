 Car Price Data Analysis Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Overview
-----------------------------------------------
This project focuses on analyzing used car sales data to understand what factors influence car prices. The dataset contains over 500,000 vehicle records with details like make, model, year, condition, mileage, transmission type, and selling price.

The goal of this project is to clean the raw data, explore patterns, and build insights that help explain how different features affect the final selling price of a car.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset Details
----------------------------------------------------------
The dataset includes the following main columns:

1) Year of manufacture

2) Make and model

3) Trim and body type

4) Transmission

5) State

6) Vehicle condition score

7) Odometer (mileage)

8) Color

9) MMR (market reference price)

10) Selling price

Total records: ~528K

Total features: 12

Analysis Performed
---------------
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was done to answer questions like:

1) How does mileage affect selling price?

2) Do newer cars always sell higher?

3) Which brands hold value better?

4) How does vehicle condition impact price?

5) Difference between MMR and actual selling price

6) Transmission and body type price trends

----------------------------------------
Key Insights
--------------------------------------
1) Lower mileage cars generally sell at higher prices

2) Vehicle condition score strongly impacts final price

3) Some brands show better resale value stability

4) Selling price often deviates from MMR based on condition and demand

5) Newer model years trend higher but with brand variation

-----------------------------------------------
Tools Used
-------------------

1) Python

2) Pandas

3) NumPy

4) Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

5) SQL (for query-based checks)

6) Power BI (for dashboard — if you built one, keep this line)

----------------------------

Possible Extensions
--------------------------
1) Future improvements that can be added:

2) Price prediction model (regression / ML)

3) Brand-wise depreciation analysis

4) State-wise market comparison

5) Feature importance ranking

6) Interactive dashboard layer

-----------------------------
 How to Use
-------------------------

1) Download the dataset file

2) Open the notebook/script

3) Run data cleaning steps

4) Execute EDA sections

5) Review charts and summary outputs

----------------------------------

Project Purpose
--------------------------------------
This project was created as part of a data analyst portfolio to demonstrate:

1) Real-world data cleaning

2) Large dataset handling

3) Exploratory analysis workflow

4) Insight generation

5) Business-focused interpretation
